#Variables are temporary locations for storing data.

y = 10.0

#A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

number_0f_shoes = "six"
name = "william"

print(name+" has "+number_0f_shoes+" pairs of shoes")
